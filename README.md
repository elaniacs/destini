# Destini

## Goal

The goal of this challenge is implementing the MVC design pattern and thinking about the state of app. In addition, reviewing the concept of Swift Structures and using it to separate the Model from the Controller. 

## What I created

In this app, you will be creating a “choose your own adventure” game similar to the App Store hit “Life Line” app. The app will tell a story depending on what the user chooses and can be fleshed out and modified to provide an engaging story-telling experience
